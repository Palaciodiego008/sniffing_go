# sniffing_go



This is a Go code that captures network packets on a specified network interface, applies a filter to capture only packets with a specific port and protocol (in this case TCP and port 443, which is the default port for HTTPS traffic), and inspects the payload of the captured packets for sensitive information such as usernames and passwords.
